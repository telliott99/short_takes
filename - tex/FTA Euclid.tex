We will prove that every integer has a unique prime factorization.

\[ n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_i \]

In this list of prime factors, a factor may be repeated.  For example $12 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$.

This is our version of the standard proof of the theorem.  A preliminary result that is needed for this version is called Euclid's lemma, which depends on yet another preliminary result.

\subsection*{Euclid's lemma}

Every positive integer greater than 1 is either prime, or it is the product of two smaller natural numbers $a$ and $b$.

But the same is true of $a$ and $b$ in turn.  So every $n = ab$ is the product of the prime factors of $a$ times the prime factors of $b$.

Suppose that a given prime $p$ divides $n=ab$, i.e. $p|n$.

Then $p|a$ or $p|b$, or both.

\subsection*{proof of Euclid}

The proof depends on B\'ezout's identity (or lemma), which we look at elsewhere.  B\'ezout says that for $a,p \in \mathbb{N}$, there exist integers $r$ and $s$ such that
\[ ra + sp = d \]

where $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $p$.

Of course, if $p$ is prime, then
\[ ra + sp = 1 \]

Suppose that $p|n = ab$ but $p$ does not divide $a$ so that gcd$(p,a) = 1$.

Then, we can find a linear combination of $a$ and $p$ in the integers such that:
\[ ra + sp = 1 \]

But then, 
\[ b(ra + sp) = b \]
\[ rab + spb = b \]

Since $p|p$ and $p|ab$ (by hypothesis), $p|b$, as desired.

(If $p | m$ then $m = jp$ for some (integer) $j$, similarly if $p | n$ then $n = kp$ for some $k$ so $m + n = (j + k)p$ which means that $p | m + n$).

\subsection*{example}

Note that this is not necessarily true for non-primes.  For example, $6 \cdot 10 = 60 | 4$ but neither $6 | 4$ nor $10 | 4$.  This happens because $2$ is a prime factor of both $6$ and $10$, generating a factor of $4$ in the product.

\subsection*{another proof of Euclid, by contradiction}

The proof is by contradiction.  Suppose $p$ is prime and and $p | ab$ but $p$ divides neither $a$ nor $b$.

Because $a$ and $p$ are co-prime, Bezout says that there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that:
\[ ax + py = 1 \]

similarly (because $b$ and $p$ are co-prime) there exist $X$ and $Y$ such that:
\[ bX + pY = 1 \]
    
so
\[ 1 = (ax + py)(bX + pY) \]
\[ 1 = axbX + axpY + pybX + p^2yY \]
\[ 1 = ab(xX) + p(axY + ybX + pyY) \]
    
Since $p | ab$, $p$ divides the right hand side, so $p$ divides the left-hand side, that is, $p | 1$.  But this is absurd.  

Therefore,  $p$ divides at least one of $a$ and $b$.

\subsection*{proof of FTA by induction}

Assume the lemma is true for all numbers between $1$ and $n$. It is certainly true for $n < 31$, because we can check each case.

If $n$ is prime there is nothing to prove and we move to $n + 1$.

If $n$ is not prime, then there exist integers $a$ and $b$ (with $1 < a \le b < n$) such that $n = a \cdot b$.

By the induction hypothesis, since $a < n$ and $b < n$, $a$ has prime factors $p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots$ and $b$ has prime factors $q_1 \cdot q_2 \dots$ so
\[ n = ab = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots  q_1 \cdot q_2 \dots \]

This shows there exists a prime factorization of $n$.

\subsection*{uniqueness}

To show that the prime factorization is unique, suppose that $n$ is the smallest integer for which there exist two different factorizations:
\[ n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_i \]
and
\[ n = q_1 \cdot q_2 \dots q_j \]

Pick the first factor $p_1$.  Since $p_1$ divides $n = q_1 q_2 \dots$, by Euclid's lemma, it must divide some particular $q_j$.  Rearrange the $q$'s to make that $q$ the first one.

But since $p_1$ divides $q_1$ and both are prime, it follows that $p_1 = q_1$.

As wikipedia says now:

\begin{quote}This can be done for each of the $m$ $p_i$'s, showing that $m \le n$ and every $p_i$ is some $q_j$.  Applying the same argument with the $p$'s and $q$'s reversed shows $n \le m$ (hence $m = n$) and every $q_j$ is a $p_i$.\end{quote}

$\square$
