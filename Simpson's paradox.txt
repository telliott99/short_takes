Consider a hypothetical university with only two departments, humanities and engineering, which differ in their admission rates for graduate students.  

Broken down by sex, the admission rates are

    HUM    ENG

F   40%    80%
M   20%    60%

Clearly, both departments admit a smaller percentage of male applicants than females.  This is probably because it was 1950 and the very few women who applied tended to be really smart.

Since we are talking percentages, the number of applicants doesn't matter.  However, there is another important variable, namely, the distribution of applicants grouped by sex, comparing the two departments.

As an extreme example, suppose the men only apply to engineering and women only apply to humanities.  Then the overall admission rates will be

F   40%
M   60%

And if 3/4 of the male applicants apply to engineering

M   3/4(60%) + 1/4(20%) = 50%

while only 1/4 of females apply to engineering

F   1/4(80%) + 3/4(40%) = 50%

the overall rates appear to be the same. 

This is called Simpson's Paradox.  

The example is a vastly simplified version of a real-life example.

Another famous example involves batting averages for two baseball players, Derek Jeter and David Justice in 1995 and 1996.

         1995              1996             combined

Jeter     12/ 48 = 0.250   183/582 = .314   195/630 = .310
Justice  104/411 = 0.253    45/140 = .321   149/551 = .270

David Justice had a slightly better average than Jeter in both years, but when the data are combined he is 40 points lower than Derek Jeter.

The explanation is that although their averages are pretty similar in both years and both were much lower in 1995, Derek Jeter had a small number of at-bats in a relatively poor year for him in 1995, while David Justice had a small number at-bats in a relatively good year in 1996.
